Create a simple app that demontrates CRUD operations using 
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React](https://react.dev/)
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
* [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)
* [Mock API](https://mockapi.io)

### CRUD Operations
`C`reate `R`ead `U`pdate `D`elete
These terms describe the four essential operations for creating and managing persistent data elements.

This example is a landing page that is hooked to an instance of a `Mock API` endpoint. Users can create, edit or delete a user. Also, users can view the list of users created.

### MVC
`M`odel `V`iew `C`ontroller
Data and schema on `Mock API` are the model. When the state of said data changes, it notifies the view (the relevant component) so the display can change as needed and the controller (if different logic is needed to control the updated view).
